# Handwritten-Image-Recognition-Using-Tensorflow

The purpose of this project is created a neural network to recognize hand-written numbers with the MNIST data library, and improve the recognition speed by parallelizing the code with Tensorflow.

## Abstract

Image recognition can be a difficult task, but we can work around this with the use of the concept of neural networks. Neural networks allow us to teach an algorithm or "machine" the difference between what is right and wrong, based on paramters we can establish. To scale this application, we can also implement the use of GPU parallel programming like CUDA into our algorithm to speed up applications that might take up alot more processes to complete. 

## Neural Networks 

In its simplest form, a neural network is modeled off the wway our brains work, using synapes to pass electrical signal, or highs and lows. The same can be done to train a model or algorithm what 'right" and "wrong". 

The inputs of a neural network are multiplied by weights, which are in turn added together and given a particular bias. This resulting sum is then passed through an activation function to produce a certain output. Activation function act as a gateway for neurons to send their output from one neuron to the next. The activation function we will be using specifically for this project is the Rectified Linear Unit Function or ReLU function for short. 

Below we can see a simpel flow chart for the process of a simple neural network
